Data_Stucture_Programs
======================

All the programs of Data Structure as a part of assignment work during Second Semester at DA-IICT.

Used Unix as OS and Gedit as editor. 

All the programs require g++ compiler and input from file. And it should be run on shell using commands like
G++ <FileNamw>.cpp

To Run the file enter
./a.out <path of the text file> (one can just drag and drop the file into command line)
